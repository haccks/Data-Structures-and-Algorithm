# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm
All the basic operations on Data Structures and standard algorithms are implemented in C.
Programs are written in strict C99 mode. Make sure that you are compiling these programs
with the option "-std=c99" (without quotes). If you are using an IDE, like Code::Blocks,
then add this flag to the compiler option.
